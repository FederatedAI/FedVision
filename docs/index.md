At this version, FedVision utilize 
 [PaddleFL](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleFL) 
 and [PaddleDetection](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleDetection) 
 to achieve `Gradient Average` strategy. We aim to implement many
 awesome Features such as
 
 - Google's Secure Aggregation protocol
 
 - Gradient compression
 
 - pytorch support
